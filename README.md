This script compresses the HTML code coverage report generated by PHPUnit into a single HTML file.

What is this good for?
======================
I use this script with CircleCI to reduce the run time of workflows when the HTML reports are stored as artifacts.
It can take a long time to upload code coverage reports containing hundreds of HTML files and compressing the report into
a single file + static assets fixes this.
